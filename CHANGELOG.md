Nothing yet.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-30

Initial release.

### Added

- **Admin settings screen** at *WooCommerce → BOGO Select*: enable/disable, offer
  title, Buy quantity, Get quantity, Buy scope, Get scope, repeat mode, and a
  toggle for the site-wide qualification notice.
- **Independent Buy and Get scopes**, each set to *All Products* or *Select
  Products* with its own AJAX-searched product list.
- **Arbitrary Buy/Get quantities** — any positive integers (Buy 2 Get 2,
  Buy 4 Get 8, …).
- **Customer gift chooser** on the cart page: product cards with image, name,
  price, stock state, and Select/Change actions, added via AJAX.
- **$0.00 reward line items** — the chosen gift is added as a real cart line with
  its price overridden to zero, so WooCommerce reduces stock normally.
- **Continuous cart re-validation** — the gift is removed or its quantity adjusted
  automatically when the cart stops qualifying, the offer changes, or stock runs
  short, with an explanatory customer notice.
- **Quantity lock** on gift line items (removal still permitted).
- **Server-side re-validation** of every selection, and again on
  `woocommerce_check_cart_items` before checkout, so a crafted request cannot
  award a free product.
- **Repeat mode** (off by default) awarding one gift set per multiple of the Buy
  quantity.
- **"Free (BOGO)" labelling** on cart lines, checkout, order emails, and the admin
  order screen.
- **Developer hooks**: `bogo_select_get_products`, `bogo_select_qualifies`,
  `bogo_select_reward_quantity`, `bogo_select_reward_added`.
- **HPOS compatibility** declaration for WooCommerce High-Performance Order Storage.
- **Uninstall routine** removing plugin options.
- Project documentation: `README.md`, `BRIEF.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`,
  `DECISION.md`, `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`, and this changelog.

### Known limitations

- Classic (shortcode) cart and checkout only — Cart/Checkout **blocks** show the
  notice but not the chooser. See `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` Q-001.
- One offer at a time; offers do not stack.
- Product IDs only — no category, tag, or attribute scoping.
- Variable products cannot be gifts (they remain eligible on the Buy side).
  See `DECISION.md` D-006.
- Untested against Subscriptions, Bundles, and Composite Products.
